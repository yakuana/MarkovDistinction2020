# MarkovDistinction2020
Use a Markov chain (or Markov model) to create a piece of visual art that you would find meaningful. You can use any programming language you wish for this assignment. Other forms of art may be incorporated, but visual art should be the major focus. You are allowed to consult your peers for help on this assignment. These conversations can take place informally or through our Blackboard discussion forum. You are also allowed to look at examples in books and on the internet as you learn.  There are two major challenges for this task. First, your code must be unique to you, and what it produces must be unique to you. This assignment will help us prepare for later assignments where you will be asked to work more independently. It is purposefully vague, and will also give us some experience with preparing for a job in tech (for example, prior students have talked about this assignment in job interviews). Ultimately, this will be a test of your creativity (!), resourcefulness, and ability to collaborate with your peers.

## How to Run the code 
 - open MARKOVDISTINCTION2020 in VSCode 
 - use the terminal to cd into the markov file 
 - type in terminal yarn start 

## System Title  
 - Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down? 

## Why this System is Meaningful and Creative ... 
Predicting user selection is something that coul be useful for navigating users to certian websites via advertisements or different section of a website given their previous selections. This way a web developer could improve the user flow and or have more control over the user's next move. I would like to create websites in the future that are easy to use, but also direct user traffic in a strategic and purposeful manner. The most challenging aspect of this project was understanding what a Markov chain should do. After researching and reading the mission description Professor Harmon has provided, I have concluded that Markkov chains use probability to predict the likelyhood a sequence of events will occur in a specified order. The next steps moving forward would be to house the user data in a database so that I could increase my datapool and create more accurate probability statistics for the Markov chains produced. As there  are only two options for user selection (thumbs up or thumbs down), there are four possible sequences of events excluding not clicking am image {(up, up), (up, down), (down, up), (down, down)}. It would be interesting to add more images with more of a contrasting relation to see how the data changes. 

I think that this project is somewhat creative as it allows for user interaction and there is some portions of the data presented and the content that shows on the website that are left completely in the hands of the user.
