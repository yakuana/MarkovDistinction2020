# MarkovDistinction2020
Use a Markov chain (or Markov model) to create a piece of visual art that you would find meaningful. You can use any programming language you wish for this assignment. Other forms of art may be incorporated, but visual art should be the major focus. You are allowed to consult your peers for help on this assignment. These conversations can take place informally or through our Blackboard discussion forum. You are also allowed to look at examples in books and on the internet as you learn.  There are two major challenges for this task. First, your code must be unique to you, and what it produces must be unique to you. This assignment will help us prepare for later assignments where you will be asked to work more independently. It is purposefully vague, and will also give us some experience with preparing for a job in tech (for example, prior students have talked about this assignment in job interviews). Ultimately, this will be a test of your creativity (!), resourcefulness, and ability to collaborate with your peers.
